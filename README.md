This is the Github repo for my [Blog @ Mark's Math](https://blog.marksmath.org) webpage. It's Apache 2.0 licensed so anyone is free to download it and learn from it.

The Blog @ Mark's Math is a [Quarto project](https://quarto.org/). If you download the project and install Quarto, then you should be able to simply cd from the command line into the project folder and execute
