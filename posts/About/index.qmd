The Blog @ Mark's Math is built on top of [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which isn't a standard blogging tool like Wordpress or Medium or Ghost or some such. Since the use of tech in educational writing is one of my main topics, I thought it might make sense to start with a description of the tech stack for this site as a first blog post!

## Quarto 

Quarto's web site describes it as 

> An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

From my perspective, that means that it's built to facilitate the process of creating webpages and PDFs using tools that those of us in the technical disciplines are familiar with.
