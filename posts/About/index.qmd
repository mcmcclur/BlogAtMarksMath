Like [Mark's Math itself](https://marksmath.org/), the *Blog @ Mark's Math* is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), which isn't a standard blogging tool like Wordpress or Medium or Ghost or some such. Quarto is a more general tool for publishing in many formats and it focuses, more specifically, on producing technical documents. If that makes no sense, perhaps I should show why Quarto is a great choice for a technical blog in academia and discuss the tech stack for this site more generally.

Sounds like a good first blog post!

## Quarto 

Quarto's web site describes it as 

> An open-source scientific and technical publishing system

From my perspective, that means that it's built to facilitate the process of creating webpages and PDFs using tools that those of us in the technical disciplines are familiar with. Here are a few of the highlights:

### Input 

For the most part, the primary content of Quarto documents are authored in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Quarto's markdown syntax is extended a bit but still much lighter than HTML or LaTeX, which is a major draw for me.

### Output 

Quarto can create documents in multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, Word, and Open Office. You can view [this page in PDF format](AboutTheBlog.pdf), for example. Quarto can also produce several presentation formats, namely Powerpoint, Beamer, and RevealJS. All of this is super convenient in an academic context; I can write my webpages, presentations, and exams all with this same tool. You can view this very post in [PDF format](AboutTheBlog.pdf), for example. 

### Mathematical typesetting 

If you're writing in a technical discipline, then you need mathematical typesetting. The de facto standard for writing mathematics is LaTeX, so Quarto translates LaTeX snippets into mathematics in HTML or PDF. For example, to write

If $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$, then 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.$$

I could type

    If $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$, then 
    $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.$$


The result can be rendered using either MathJax or KaTeX in an HTML setting or using LaTeX itself within a PDF.

### Computer code 

Quarto makes it easy to incorporate code into your documents. You can display the input, display the output, or integrate that output into your document. We might sum the first 100 positive integers and display the result for example: 

```{python}
#| echo: true 
s = 0
for i in range(101):
    s = s+i 
print(s)
```

You can incorporate Python, Julia, R, or Javascript in this manner. For more complicated cases, you can fold the code or hide it all together.
