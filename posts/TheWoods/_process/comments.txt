This directory stores the files used to generate the overlay MySketch.geojson displayed over the woods that shows the proposed construction plans. I used Adobe Illustrator to trac the image on page 12 of this Board of Governors' meeting notes:

The SVG was converted to GeoJSON using the custom convert_sketch.py script. Finally, I edited and simplified that a bit further using mapshaper.org and merged some other data in.
