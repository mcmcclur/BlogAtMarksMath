I used Adobe Illustrator to remove some text, trace the outline of the region I wanted, and export that result to PNG. I then vectorized the result using vectormagic.com to generate an SVG. (I also tried Illustrator for this purpose but preferred the results generated by vecotrmagic.com.) The SVG was converted to GeoJSON using the custom convert_new.py script. Finally, I edited and simplified that a bit further using mapshaper.org
